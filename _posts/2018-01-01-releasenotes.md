Examples of release notes projects I worked on at [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"} and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com){:target="blank"}. Samples include monthly blog-style release notes and compilations for major releases.

### Lotus Notes, Domino, and Domino Designer Release Notes
I was the writer, editor, and project manager for this release notes documentation for the IBM Lotus Notes suite of products. This document is the compilation of all the individual release notes entries. Each release note was written in a separate document in a content database application, which facilitated workflow and allowed for micro-consumption of the content as individual pieces, or the assembly of all the content into a complete document.

### Quick Base Release Notes
Here are examples of monthly release notes for Quick Base. I tracked all the enhancements and fixes and wrote all the entries. The voice and tone for these release notes are a blend of technical marketing and user guide material.

These samples were assembled in Wordpress and published as part of the company blog:
