I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} to design and publish this portfolio. You can see the source code repository here: [github.com/craiglordan/craiglordan.github.io](https://github.com/craiglordan/craiglordan.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

#### Setup
Here are highlights of the steps I took to get set up. For full instructions, read [Working with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).
<ol>
<li><p>Create a personal account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a public repository in the syntax: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name.github.io</code>. This is required for GitHub Pages to work.</p></li>
<li><p>In Settings for the repository, in the <b>GitHub Pages</b> section, choose the source branch. This enables Pages for the repository.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/gh-settings.png" width="400"></p></li>
<li><p>Also in Settings, you can use the <b>Theme Chooser</b> to select how your pages are going to look. There is a set of default <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> themes from which you can choose.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to use another Jekyll theme from elsewhere, you can download and add the theme to your repository, then edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file to add these lines:</p>
</li>
</ol>
```
# Build settings
theme: minima
```

#### Theme customization
I used the default Jekyll theme, [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima){:target="_blank"}, as the basis for this site design.

Here are images of the default theme in comparison to this site:

<div class="postrow">
  <div class="postcolumn">
  <p><b>Minima default</b></p>
  <a href="/assets/images/minima.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/minima.png"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="postcolumn">
  <p><b>craiglordan.github.io</b></p>
  <a href="/assets/images/minima-custom.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/minima-custom.png"></a>
  </div>
</div>


**Font**

To use the free font [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato){:target:"_blank"}, I added these lines to files in the `_sass\minima` folder:
- **custom-styles.scss**: `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&display=swap');`
- **initialize.scss**:  `$base-font-family: Lato`

**Background image**

It took me several attempts to add the background image so that it appeared the way I wanted. The final solution I chose was to add a background to the top-level html tag:
```html
html {
  background: url(/assets/images/portcanaveral-crop.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
  -webkit-background-size: cover;
  -moz-background-size: cover;
  -o-background-size: cover;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

The background image is a photo I took looking directly at the ceiling inside Disney's cruise terminal at Port Canaveral, Florida. Here's another angle:
[![](/assets/images/port-canaveral-angle.png){: width="200"}](/assets/images/port-canaveral-angle.png){:target="_blank"}

**Header and footer**

To recreate the same color transparency I had used on a previous workfolio.com portfolio, I changed this styling in `_layout.scss`:

```css
site-header {
  background-color: rgba(220, 220, 235,.87);
  }

.site-footer {
    background-color: rgba(220, 220, 235,.87);
  }
```

#### Assets
GitHub makes it easy to include the actual samples of the portfolio, stored as PDF, video, and image files.

The existing Jekyll theme included an **assets** folder. I added folders for **pdf**, **images**, and **videos** as the central place to upload samples.


#### Home page layout
I customized the **home.html** file to:
- Display content sorted by category
- Have two columns for each entry (one for the link and excerpt, one for the image)
- Include a formatted image for each entry
- Style headings and rules to organize the page

This code includes the category sorting and the inline styling to have each thumbnail image appear in a circle:
```html
{% assign sorted_cats = site.categories | sort %}
{% for category in sorted_cats %}
{% assign sorted_posts = category[1] | sort: 'title' %}
  <h2>{{ category[0] }}</h2>

    {% for post in sorted_posts %}
      <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
      <div class="homerow">

      <div class="homecolumn homeleft">
      {%- if site.show_excerpts -%}
        {{ post.excerpt }}
      {%- endif -%}
      </div>

      <div class="homecolumn homeright">
      <p><img src="{{ post.thumbnail }}" style="border-radius: 50%; border-style: solid; border-color: #dcdceb; width: 150px"/></p>
      </div>

      </div>
    {% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
```
To have each category heading appear as white text on a blue background, I added this to **custom-styles.scss**:
```css
.home h2 {
  font-weight: 400;
  line-height: 40px;
  margin-top: 50px;
  padding-left: 5px;
  background-color: #548DD4;
  color: #ffffff
}
```
To have each entry appear in two columns, I added these entries to **custom-styles.scss**:
```css
.homecolumn {
  float: left;
}

.homeleft {
  width: 65%;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

.homeright {
  width: 25%;
}

.homerow:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```
But, to be responsive for mobile devices, I also added these lines:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .homeleft {
    width: 100%;
  }

  .homeright {
    width: 100%;
  }
```

With the styles above, the home page content appears stacked rather than in columns:
[![](/assets/images/mobile-home.jpeg){: width="200"}](/assets/images/mobile-home.jpeg){:target="_blank"}

#### Markdown files
When using GitHub Pages, markdown (.md) files are automatically published as web pages. I added markdown files for each of the portfolio entries. I also used some HTML code within some markdown files in order to use other formatting, such as two- and three-column layouts.

This header section includes meta information such as **title** and **category**. The **permalink** shortens the URL path. The **thumbnail** entry sets the small image that appears on the portfolio home page.
```markdown
---
title: "Conference presentations"
layout: post
permalink: /speaking/
thumbnail: "/assets/images/thumbnails/ad112-lotus-wikis.png"
categories: [Presentations]
---
```

This snippet shows a typical piece of content, which includes a header, regular text, and a clickable image that loads one of the samples, stored as a PDF.

```markdown
Presentations from speaking engagements at customer and industry conferences.

### Development and Deployment of Lotus Product Documentation Wikis
From Lotusphere, the IBM/Lotus customer conference. I spoke with the lead developer from our team about our project to design, develop, and deploy editable wikis for product documentation, using our own Lotus Domino technology.
