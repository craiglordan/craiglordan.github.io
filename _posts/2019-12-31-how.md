I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} to design and publish this portfolio.

Here are the overall steps to take. For full instructions, read [Working with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages)

**Setup**
1. Create a personal account on [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="blank"}
2. Add a public repository in the syntax: `name.github.io`. This is required for GitHub Pages to work.
3. In Settings for the repository, use the GitHub Pages section to confirm your repo is set to publish to Pages.
4. Also in Settings, you can use the Theme Chooser to select how your pages are going to look. There is a set of default themes from which you can choose.
5. If you want to use another theme from elsewhere, you can add the theme to your repository, then edit the `_config.yml` file like this:
  `# Build settings
  theme: minima`
6.
