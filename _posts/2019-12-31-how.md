I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} to design and publish this portfolio. You can see the source code repository here: [github.com/craiglordan/craiglordan.github.io](https://github.com/craiglordan/craiglordan.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

#### Setup
Here are highlights of the steps I took to get set up. For full instructions, read [Working with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).
<ol>
<li><p>Create a personal account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a public repository in the syntax: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name.github.io</code>. This is required for GitHub Pages to work.</p></li>
<li><p>In Settings for the repository, in the <b>GitHub Pages</b> section, choose the source branch. This enables Pages for the repository.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/gh-settings.png" width="400"></p></li>
<li><p>Also in Settings, you can use the <b>Theme Chooser</b> to select how your pages are going to look. There is a set of default <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> themes from which you can choose.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to use another Jekyll theme from elsewhere, you can download and add the theme to your repository, then edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file to add these lines:</p>
</li>
</ol>

#### Markdown files
When using GitHub Pages, markdown (.md) files are automatically published as web pages. I added markdown files for each of the portfolio entries. I also used some HTML code within some markdown files in order to use other formatting, such as two- and three-column layouts.

This header section includes meta information such as **title** and **category**. The **permalink** shortens the URL path. The **thumbnail** entry sets the small image that appears on the portfolio home page.

Presentations from speaking engagements at customer and industry conferences.

### Development and Deployment of Lotus Product Documentation Wikis
From Lotusphere, the IBM/Lotus customer conference. I spoke with the lead developer from our team about our project to design, develop, and deploy editable wikis for product documentation, using our own Lotus Domino technology.
