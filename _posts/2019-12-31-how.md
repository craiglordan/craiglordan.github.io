I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} to design and publish this portfolio.

Here are the overall steps to take. For full instructions, read [Working with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).

**Setup**
<ol>
<li><p>Create a personal account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a public repository in the syntax: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name.github.io</code>. This is required for GitHub Pages to work.</p></li>
<li><p>In Settings for the repository, in the <b>GitHub Pages</b> section, choose the source branch. This enables Pages for the repository.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/gh-settings.png" width="400"></p></li>
<li><p>Also in Settings, you can use the <b>Theme Chooser</b> to select how your pages are going to look. There is a set of default themes from which you can choose.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to use another theme from elsewhere, you can add the theme to your repository, then edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file to add these lines:</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
# Build settings
theme: minima
</code>
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>step 6</p></li>
</ol>
