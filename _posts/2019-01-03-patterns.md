Examples of work I did related to content patterns and establishing processes for working on in-product copy.

### In-product content progression
This [presentation](/assets/pdf/Quick-Base-content-progression.pdf){:target="blank"} explains the foundation for working with in-product content and guidance. This provided a decision-making framework for content designers.

### Process for editing UI copy
Documents the process that UX writers can use to work directly on strings in the code repository. The idea is to enable content designers to implement and test copy changes directly, rather than passing changes to developers.
