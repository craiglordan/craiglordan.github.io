These are all examples and writing samples from user guides and API guides for products.

### Quick Base Help
At [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"}, I worked on writing new and revised content for the user guide (called **Quick Base Help**) and the API Guide.

Customers could access these guides externally from the product, plus some of the user guide topics were consumed by an in-product help menu.

These guides were written and produced using [Madcap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/){target="blank"}.

#### Links to the guides
