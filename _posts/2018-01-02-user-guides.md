### Quick Base Help
At [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"}, I worked on writing new and revised content for the user guide (called **Quick Base Help**) and the API Guide.

Customers could access these guides externally from the product, plus some of the user guide topics were consumed by an in-product help menu.

These guides were written and produced using [Madcap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/){:target="blank"}.

#### Links to the guides

#### Writing samples
Here are links to specific writing samples from the user guide:
- [PDF: Creating a relationship in Quick Base](/assets/pdf/creating-relationship.pdf){:target="blank"}. A rewrite of several existing help topics into a single entry, in order to streamline language, match brand voice and tone, and conform to a new context-sensitive help interaction.
- [PDF: Quick Base sandbox](/assets/pdf/sandbox.pdf){:target="blank"}. This is a collection of four topics covering a feature where application changes can be developed and tested without affecting the operations of the live app itself.

### Cadence documentation
At Cadence, I worked on both customer-facing and internal documentation:
- [PDF: Xcelium Save/Restart guide](/assets/pdf/saverestart.pdf){:target="blank"}. Documents a feature that allowed developers designing semiconductor simulation tests to easily save and restart the process, which saved time and provided flexibility.
- [PDF: Installing, Running, and Adding Tarkits to Cadence Help](/assets/pdf/adding-tarkits-help.pdf){:target="blank"}. Internal documentation that explained how to install a help application, then load the latest documentation files.
- [PDF: Known Problems and Solutions Process](/assets/pdf/known-problems-solutions-process.pdf){:target="blank"}. Internal documentation for writers on how to produce "known problems and solutions," which were documents that showed open issues, any available solutions, and the planned release where the issue was to be fixed.
