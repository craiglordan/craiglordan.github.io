Here are samples of specs for in-product content. These were all final specs that were the basis for development.


### "Build together" app creation copy
My spec for final content for an app creation modal for [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="_blank"}. Developers could use this series of dialogs (called **Build Together**) to choose a use case as the starting point for a new database application.

### Trial landing page content
This is final layout and content for a trial page for [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="_blank"}. This work was done as part of a project to improve the first-user experience for potential customers.

### Explanation welcome dialog
This content appeared in-product to help explain a key concept for Quick Base, which was how and why to relate tables in a database. I worked with a visual designer on the layout and images, which influenced the final copy.

### Show / hide tips
Here is my final spec, along with screens of the final live UI, for contextual, in-product help for [Carbon Black](https://www.carbonblack.com/){:target="_blank"} Defense.

I listened to several customer interviews, led by a user researcher, where we learned that administrators working on policy definitions sometimes needed clarity on the choices. The in-product content design catered to providing definitions and tips, which was just enough information for this technical audience, and prevented them from calling support for help.
