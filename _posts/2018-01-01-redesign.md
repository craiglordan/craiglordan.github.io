Here are examples of help/documentation redesign projects, where I worked on the planning, design, development, and deployment.

### Quick Base Help redesign
I was responsible for the redesign and re-theming of three customer-facing help deliverables for [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"}: a user guide, the API guide, and release notes. These are all written and produced using [Madcap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/){:target="blank"}.

Highlights of the project included:
- Applying new product branding colors and fonts
- Adding responsive layouts
- Improving accessibility
- Reorganizing all content for end user, developer, and administrator audiences
- Moved monthly release notes into a Flare project

I designed this [poster](/assets/pdf/helpredesign-poster.pdf){:target="blank"} for an internal trade show to explain and promote the project.

### Contextual help menu
I worked with product management and a developer to design and implement changes to the help menu within [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"}.

Previously, the help menu only included a search box. The new design showed contextual assistance matching the page or task.

  </div>
  <div class="postcolumn">
  <p><b>Current</b></p>
  <a href="/assets/images/help-menu-open.png"><img src="/assets/images/help-menu-open.png"></a>
  </div>
</div>

The content source is written and published in the same Madcap Flare project we used for external help, but designed to appear in the help menu.

Here are more samples from the project:
