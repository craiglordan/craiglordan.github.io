Here are examples of help/documentation redesign projects, where I worked on the planning, design, development, and deployment.

### Quick Base Help redesign
I was responsible for the redesign and re-theming of three customer-facing help deliverables for Quick Base: a user guide, the API guide, and release notes. These are all written and produced using [Madcap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/){:target="blank"}.

Highlights of the project included:
- Applying new product branding colors and fonts
- Adding responsive layouts
- Improving accessibility
- Reorganizing all content for end user, developer, and administrator audiences
- Moved monthly release notes into a Flare project
