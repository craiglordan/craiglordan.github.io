Here are examples of help/documentation redesign projects, where I worked on the planning, design, development, and deployment.


I was responsible for the redesign and re-theming of three customer-facing help deliverables for Quick Base: a user guide, the API guide, and release notes. These are all written and produced using [Madcap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/){target="blank"}.
