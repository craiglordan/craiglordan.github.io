Shows examples of guided walkthroughs, giving users a tour of features in a development environment.

The product shown in these examples is [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="_blank"} Visual Builder.

I used [Pendo](https://pendo.io){:target="_blank"} to implement all the elements (content, visuals, and flow). These walkthroughs were deployed for customer use.


### Example 1: Start from scratch
This video shows guidance for when the developer is starting a new application from scratch.

### Example 2: Build from a template
This video is similar to the above, but contains different content because the developer is starting with a use case template with the basic application elements already in place.
