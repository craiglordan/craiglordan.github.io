Shows a stepped, guided walkthrough for Visual Builder, which is the development environment for [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"}.

I used [Pendo](https://pendo.io){:target="blank"} to implement all the elements (content, visuals, and flow). These walkthroughs were deployed for customer use.

## Example 1: Start from scratch
This example shows guidance for when the developer is starting a new application from scratch.

## Example 2: Build from a template
This example is similar to the above, but contains different content because the developer is starting with a use case template with the basic application elements already in place.
