Shows a stepped, guided walkthrough for Visual Builder, which is the development environment for [Quick Base](https://www.quickbase.com){:target="blank"}.

This example shows guidance for when the developer is starting a new application from scratch.

I used [Pendo](https://pendo.io){:target="blank"} to implement all the elements of the guides.
